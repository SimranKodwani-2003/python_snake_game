Title: Python Snake Game using Tkinter<br>

Description: I developed a classic Snake Game in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The game allows players to control a snake that grows in size as it consumes food, with the objective being to avoid colliding with the game boundaries or the snake's own body.
<br>
Key features:
<br>
GUI Development: Utilized Tkinter to design and implement the game interface, including real-time snake movement, food generation, and score tracking.
Game Mechanics: The game supports directional controls, collision detection, and increases the snake's length and speed as the score progresses.
Object-Oriented Design: Implemented the snake and food as Python classes, encapsulating game logic within reusable structures.
Real-Time Game Over Detection: The game detects collisions with boundaries and self-collisions, prompting a game-over message when the player loses.
Dynamic Window Resizing: The game window is automatically centered on the screen with dynamic size calculation for a clean user experience.
This project allowed me to sharpen my skills in Python programming, GUI development with Tkinter, and implementing game loops and event handling.
